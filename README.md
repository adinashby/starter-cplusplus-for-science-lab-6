# C++ Programming For Science - Lab 6

This template repository is the starter project for C++ Programming For Science Lab 6. Written in C++, and tested with CMake/Catch2.

### Question(s)

1. Create a `Rectangle` class with private members for width and height. Provide public member functions to set and get the dimensions of the rectangle, and to calculate the area.

2. Convert a struct `Point` that stores `x` and `y` coordinates into a class. Ensure all members are private, and write public methods to access and modify these members.

3. Create a dynamic array of pointers to `Circle` objects. Each `Circle` class should have a radius, and methods to set the radius and calculate the area. Use a constructor to set the radius.

4. Define a struct `Employee` that holds an employee's ID and name. Create an array of `Employee` pointers and initialize it with new `Employee` instances.
